/**
 * This package contains classes that generate artifacts from Velocity templates. See the accompanying
 * scala test file for this class to see how to wire it up and use it. 
 * 
 * Any Velocity template files that exist in the directory identified by the "template.directory"
 * property in the dao.properties file get files generated. 
 * 
 * You can also generate things at runtime from velocity templates. I will
 * write more about that later and probably chnge the API of the classes in the this package
 * to accomodate this idea.
