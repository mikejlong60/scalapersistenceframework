/**
 * This package contains the components that provide convenient abstractions around
 * JDBC Metadata. Using the classes here your application can reason about the characteristics
 * of a database schema, its tables, and the table's columns.  You can use it to generate artifacts
 * as I have done in the case of the VelocityCodeGenerator. Or you can attach to an application 
 * and infer information about the database to which your application is connected. This capability
 * is most useful when you have used the VelocityCodeGenerator class to create the DAO classes for an 
 * application because you have absolute naming consistency emanating from the database.
