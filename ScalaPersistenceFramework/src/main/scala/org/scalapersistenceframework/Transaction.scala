/**
 * This class represents a transaction for an SQL database. Use
 * {@link #configure(String)} to obtain to configure the transaction object for
 * given database name. Then use {@link #configure(String)} to get an instance
 * for use in a DAO or transaction service object. The specific instance
 * returned depends on the properties file configuration. It provides methods to
 * start a transaction, get the current connection for a transaction, commit a
 * transaction, and roll back a transaction. Transactions are assigned per
 * thread so that this class can behave according to the rules of EJB or
 * Springframework declarative transactions. A typical use case for this class
 * is as follows: 1) A method registers itself as owning a transaction using
 * start(String transactionOwner). This method does nothing if there is already
 * a transaction in process for the current thread. 2) A DAO class obtains the
 * connection associated with the current transaction from the
 * currentTransactionForThread instance variable and issues some SQL statements.
 * The currentTransactionForThread field uses thread local storage. 3) The
 * method that started the transaction commits the transaction using the commit
 * method here. 4)The owner of the transaction then ends the transaction to
 * clean up resources(e.g. Return the database connection to the connection pool
 * and destroying the threadLocal to prevent memory leaks.
 *
 *
 * This class contains an internal CurrentConnection object which contains the
 * database connection and the transaction owner. This mechanism allows methods
 * to behave as per the "REQUIRED" EJB transaction attribute.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * From the EJB Documentation: Required Attribute - If the client is running
 * within a transaction and invokes the enterprise bean's method, the method
 * executes within the clien's transaction. If the client is not associated
 * with a transaction, the container starts a new transaction before running the
 * method.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * In Addition, this class requires a properties file named 'dao.properties' at the root
 * of the classpath with each of the following properties:
 *
 * <pre>
 * name.url *
 * name.driver
 * name.username
 * name.password
 * </pre>
 *
 * Those marked with * are required, others are optional and can be left away or
 * empty. Only the username is required when any password is specified.
 * <ul>
 * <li>The 'name' must represent the database name in
 * {@link #getInstance(String)}.</li>
 * <li>The 'name.url' must represent either the JDBC URL or JNDI name of the
 * database.</li>
 * <li>The 'name.driver' must represent the full qualified class name of the
 * JDBC driver.</li>
 * <li>The 'name.username' must represent the username of the database login.</li>
 * <li>The 'name.password' must represent the password of the database login.</li>
 * </ul>
 * If you specify the driver property, then the url property will be assumed as
 * JDBC URL. If you omit the driver property, then the url property will be
 * assumed as JNDI name. When using JNDI with username/password preconfigured,
 * you can omit the username and password properties as well.
 * <p
 * Here are basic examples of valid properties for a database with the name
 * 'javabase':
 *
 * <pre>
 * javabase.jdbc.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/javabase
 * javabase.jdbc.driver = com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
 * javabase.jdbc.username = java
 * javabase.jdbc.password = d$7hF_r!9Y
 * </pre>
 *
 * <pre>
 * javabase.jndi.url = java:comp/env/jdbc/myds
 * </pre>
 *
 * Here is a basic use example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Transaction.configure(&quot;postgres.jdbc&quot;)
 * </pre>
